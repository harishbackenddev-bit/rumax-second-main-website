            "RUMAX LIMITED was founded with a clear and simple mission: to provide high-quality, professional healthcare services where they are most effective and comfortable - in the home.",
            "Our journey began with a focus on Domiciliary Care in Essex. We recognised that for many individuals and families, the best care is not just about clinical tasks; it is about dignity, independence, and the peace of mind that comes from being in familiar surroundings. By combining a compassionate, person-centred approach with rigorous professional standards, we established ourselves as a trusted local provider across Basildon, Southend, Brentwood, and the wider Essex area.",
            "As our reputation for reliability and quality grew, so did our vision. We saw a significant gap in the clinical research landscape: the need for dependable, protocol-driven clinical trial delivery that could reach participants across the UK. Leveraging our deep roots in homecare and our commitment to clinical excellence, we launched our Homecare Clinical Trials Service - and today we are proud to partner with global vendors, CROs, and NHS Trusts to deliver complex protocol activities, from PK sampling to IMP administration, in participants' homes nationwide."
