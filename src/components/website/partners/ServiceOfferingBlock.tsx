          </div>

          <p>
            We are not a generalist staffing agency. Rumax is a
            CQC-registered, ISO 9001:2015-certified specialist whose nurses,
            SOPs, and quality systems are purpose-built for clinical research —
            so the homecare arm of your trial carries the same governance as the
            site.
